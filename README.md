## Overview

I used HTML and CSS to take on this challenge. It is the first challenge on the Building Responsive Layout path and designed for learners to practice responsive tools such as Media quaries and fluid typography.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

1. Do research
2. Start HTML with semantic elements and try to make a layout that is easier to style with css later
3. Start CSS after completing the first draft of HTML. 
4. Go back and forth to modify/update both files whenever necessary

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Things I learnt from previous challenges
- [CSS reset] (https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)

### What I learned

I learned how `<img>` and `<picture>` tags work defferently in responsive design and some attributes other than alt and src, which were new to me.
